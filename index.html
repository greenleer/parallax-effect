          <h3>Use The Force, Luke</h3>
          <p>Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! And the hat. She's a witch! He hasn't got shit all over him. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
          <p>And the hat. She's a witch! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>

          <p>But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Marry me. Noâ€¦ but I'd like to be asked! Well, what do you expect, mother?</p>
          <p>Really? Did nothing cancel? That's why you always leave a note! No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
